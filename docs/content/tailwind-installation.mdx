## Installing Tailwind (PostCSS)

Open a terminal at your project root and run:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss
```

This installs Tailwind CSS along with PostCSS & Autoprefixer, and creates default `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` in your project.

---

## Add PostCSS configuration

Add @tailwindcss/postcss to your postcss.config.mjs file, or wherever PostCSS is configured in your project.

```js
export default {
    plugins: {
        "@tailwindcss/postcss": {},
    }
}
```

Then add the Tailwind directives to your global CSS (or equivalent) file:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

Run your project to see the changes.

```bash
npm run dev
```
