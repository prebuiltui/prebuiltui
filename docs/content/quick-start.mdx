---

## Prerequisites

PrebuiltUI is built entirely with **Tailwind CSS**, so installing and configuring Tailwind is the only prerequisite.

Before using PrebuiltUI, make sure you have:

- A project using **Next.js**, **React**, **Vite**, **Vue** or plain **HTML**
- **Tailwind CSS** configured in your project

> If you're new to Tailwind CSS, check out the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).
---

## Install Tailwind CSS

Follow the standard Tailwind installation based on your framework. For example, with Next.js:

> We recommend using the official [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for advanced setup.


```bash
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/cli
```

### Import Tailwind

Add the @import "tailwindcss"; import to your main CSS file.


```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

### Start the Tailwind

```bash
npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch
```

---

## Use Components

Once Tailwind is set up, you're ready to use PrebuiltUI.

Just copy any component from the PrebuiltUI library and paste it into your project.

Example:

```html
<button class="px-4 py-2 rounded-lg bg-black text-white hover:bg-gray-800">
  Button
</button>
```

Every component is fully customizable using Tailwind classes.

## Customize Components

PrebuiltUI components use utility classes, so you can modify:

- Colors
- Spacing
- Typography
- Layout
- Animations

Example modification:

```html
<button class="px-6 py-3 rounded-xl bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700">
  Primary Button
</button>
```
